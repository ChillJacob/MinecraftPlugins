#SimpleSilkSpawners

Very lightweight plugin that allows mob spawners to drop items if mined with silk touch. Simple put the worlds you want players to be able to break spawners into the config, add the permission, and you're good to go.


### Commands:
- **/sssreload**
  - Reloads the config file.
   
### Permissions
- *sss.break* : permission needed to drop spawners with silk touch
- *sss.admin* : allows use of **/sssreload**
