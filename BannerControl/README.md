Want a way to earn your server a little extra money or just want a way to have unique rewards for players?

BannerControl allows you to limit how many layers players can put on banners. It also allows banners to be assigned to players (sort of like a Coat of Arms)

Commands:
/showbanners - opens an inventory view of all the banners a player owns
