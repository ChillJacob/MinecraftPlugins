#BannerControl

Want a way to earn your server a little extra money or just want a way to have unique rewards for players?

BannerControl allows you to limit how many layers players can put on banners. It also allows banners to be assigned to players (sort of like a Coat of Arms)

This plugin uses the codes generated by http://www.needcoolshoes.com/banner to assign banners

### Commands:
- **/assignbanner <player> (banner code) (banner lore)**
  - Allows you to assign a banner to a player.
  - If you don't provide a banner code, it will attempt to assign the banner currently in your hand. However, since minecraft apparently no longer stores the banner's base color, this probably won't work unless it was generated by a /give command
  - The banner code is a code generated from [this website](http://www.needcoolshoes.com/banner). After creating a banner, you can use the last bit of the url as the code. For example: If you created a banner and got the url http://www.needcoolshoes.com/banner?=fabFkwihjpfbaz, you would use the code after "banner?=", so fabFkwihjpfbaz.
  - You can also supply banner lore, but only if you provide a banner code as well.

- **/showbanners (player)**
  - Displays banners assigned to a yourself or another player. Opens an inventory screen which you can then grab the assigned banners out of

- **/delbanner **
  - This allows you to remove banner assignments. First, use **/showbanner** to open the banner inventory, grab a banner out of it, hold it, then run the command. It will remove any assignments from that banner.


- **/bannercontrolreload **
  - Reloads the banner and player storage files, along with the config.
  - Aliases: bcreload, bcr, bannerreload
