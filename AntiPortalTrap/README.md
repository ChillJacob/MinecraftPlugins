#AntiPortalTrap

This is an extremely lightweight plugin that does one thing: Prevents player from becoming trapped in a nether portal.

Every so often (especially if you have some sort of grief prevention plugin) a player will enter a portal and find themself in a situation where they are stuck inside portal blocks. This means they can't use commands, can't chat, and if they can't break blocks, they are stuck until they die.

Solution? Next time they are logged in, if they are stuck in a portal they will be transported to spawn. This does require that your players have access to a /spawn command (eventually I'll make this a little more robust, but it's not very high on my priorities list)
